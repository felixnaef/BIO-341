Ayant été très présente dans les forêts québécoises durant les années 60 et 70, la T.B.E. ne s'est pas attirée la sympathie de la population. En effet, les dommages qui lui sont attribuables au cours de la dernière épidémie représentent plus de 235 millions de mètres cubes de bois, soit l'équivalent de dix années de récolte pour l'industrie forestière.
